# Day 5 - Supply Stacks

The input depicts the starting stacks of crates and the rearrangement procedure.

```
    [D]    
[N] [C]    
[Z] [M] [P]
 1   2   3 

move 1 from 2 to 1
move 3 from 1 to 3
move 2 from 2 to 1
move 1 from 1 to 2
```

Part one: Crates are moved one at a time.

Part two: All the crates of each instruction are moved at the same time, preserving their order.

The goal is to find which crate will end up on top of each stack.
