# Day 1 - Calorie Counting

The input represents the number of calories of food carried by each Elf:
```
1000
2000
3000

4000

5000
6000

7000
8000
9000

10000
```
The first Elf carries `1000 + 2000 + 3000 = 6000` calories. The second, `4000`. And so on.

Part One: The objective is to know **how many calories** are being carried by the Elf carrying the **most** calories.

Part Two: Find the **top three** Elves carrying the most calories. Then, **sum** the calories of the those three Elves.
